Why oh why?
========================================================


Humanity has reached dizzying hights in terms of economic progress ... but

- Our main metric of economic growth is throughput (GDP), and
- Greater economic prosperity does not necessarily equate to societal welfare or sustainability



We can do better
========================================================

As the bright bunch that we are, we can explore new ways to:

- Measure the true state of of our trajectory, and 
- Manage the resulting issues 

Enter the shiny app!

Happy Planet Index (HPI) shiny app
========================================================


This Shiny application lets you explore one alternative, the HPI.

You can look at the HPI for each country, look at the underlying indicators and compare with GDP.

You can take a closer look at how the underlying indicators influence the index ... and perhaps identify some shortcommings. 

HPI gives a 77.41 for a country with a life expectancy of 70, 'wellbeing' of 5 and ecological footprint of 3.


What do you think?

Thank you. And enjoy exploring this index and new ways to measure humanities development into the future.
